ChanFAD is a web application that allows for viewing of protein annotations with the National Center for Biotechnology Information's iCn3D viewer (Wang et al., 2020). 
The files found here are the Django implementation for the database itself: the core of which are the implementation of the Channel model class, and the display thereof.

The channel class contains several components:
    1. The PDB ID, which also acts as a primary key
    2. The species where the particular channel is found,
    3. The gene name,
    4. The "common" name,
    5. An iCn3D link to the annotated PDB,
    6. The ion(s) the channels pass,
    7. A link to the channel subunit's UniProt entry,
    8. A link to the channel's Channelpedia entry, if present,
    9. A link to the FASTA sequence for the channel subunit on NCBI,
    10. The annotation submitter, and
    11. The timestamp of when the annotation was submitted.

We are currently working to add a couple of other features, such as direct display of domains on the channel web pages and references where domains were characterized,
but these will come in a future release.
